# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for comprehensive testing of the BizLevel web application to ensure all core functionality works correctly. The testing will validate the complete user journey from authentication through level completion, including onboarding flows, progress tracking, and AI mentor integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to authenticate and complete onboarding so that I can access the learning platform with proper setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the web application THEN the system SHALL display the authentication screen
2. WHEN a user successfully authenticates for the first time THEN the system SHALL redirect to onboarding screen 1
3. WHEN a user completes onboarding screen 1 THEN the system SHALL proceed to onboarding screen 2
4. WHEN a user completes onboarding screen 2 THEN the system SHALL redirect to the levels map screen
5. WHEN a returning user authenticates THEN the system SHALL skip onboarding and redirect directly to levels map
6. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to navigate the levels map so that I can see my progress and access available levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the levels map THEN the system SHALL display all 30+ levels with appropriate visual indicators
2. WHEN a user has not completed any levels THEN the system SHALL show only level 1 as accessible
3. WHEN a user completes a level THEN the system SHALL unlock the next level and update visual indicators
4. WHEN a user clicks on an accessible level THEN the system SHALL navigate to the level detail screen
5. WHEN a user clicks on a locked level THEN the system SHALL display appropriate feedback without navigation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to complete level 1 with all its components so that I can progress through the learning content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters level 1 THEN the system SHALL display the text description block first
2. WHEN a user reads the text description THEN the system SHALL enable the "Next" button
3. WHEN a user clicks "Next" from text description THEN the system SHALL navigate to video 1
4. WHEN a user clicks play on a video and watches for at least 5 seconds THEN the system SHALL enable the "Next" button
5. WHEN a user clicks "Next" from a video THEN the system SHALL navigate to the corresponding test
6. WHEN a user answers a test question correctly THEN the system SHALL enable the "Next" button
7. WHEN a user answers a test question incorrectly THEN the system SHALL display hint text and "Try Again" button
8. WHEN a user clicks "Try Again" THEN the system SHALL allow retaking the question
9. WHEN a user completes all lesson components THEN the system SHALL navigate to the artifact block
10. WHEN a user reaches the artifact block THEN the system SHALL display "Complete Level" button (active regardless of download)
11. WHEN a user clicks "Complete Level" THEN the system SHALL mark level 1 as completed and unlock level 2
12. WHEN a user is within a level THEN the system SHALL provide functional "Back" button for navigation between components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a learner, I want my progress to be saved and accessible to Leo so that I can get personalized assistance based on my learning journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes any learning component THEN the system SHALL save progress to the database
2. WHEN a user refreshes the page or logs out and back in THEN the system SHALL restore their exact progress state
3. WHEN a user interacts with Leo THEN the system SHALL provide Leo access to the user's current progress data
4. WHEN Leo responds to queries THEN the system SHALL demonstrate knowledge of completed levels, lessons, and current position
5. WHEN a user completes a level THEN the system SHALL update Leo's context with the new achievement
6. WHEN progress data is corrupted or unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully without breaking the user experience

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the web application to work reliably across different browsers and screen sizes so that I can access learning content from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the app on Chrome, Firefox, or Safari THEN the system SHALL function identically
2. WHEN a user accesses the app on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL display responsive layouts
3. WHEN a user performs actions THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate loading states and feedback
4. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL handle timeouts gracefully
5. WHEN JavaScript errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors and maintain basic functionality where possible

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a learner, I want video content to play properly and tests to function correctly so that I can complete lessons without technical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks play on a video THEN the system SHALL start video playback without errors
2. WHEN a video is playing THEN the system SHALL provide standard video controls (play, pause, seek)
3. WHEN a video plays for 5 seconds THEN the system SHALL automatically mark it as completed and unlock next content
4. WHEN a user takes a test THEN the system SHALL display questions clearly with selectable answers
5. WHEN a user submits test answers THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback on correctness
6. WHEN a user passes a test THEN the system SHALL update progress and unlock subsequent content
7. WHEN video fails to load THEN the system SHALL provide error messaging and retry options

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a tester, I want all issues and malfunctions to be documented so that they can be fixed in subsequent development iterations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any functionality does not work as expected THEN the system SHALL record the issue with detailed description
2. WHEN a test fails THEN the system SHALL document the exact steps to reproduce the problem
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL capture relevant error messages and context
4. WHEN testing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive report of all identified issues
5. WHEN issues are documented THEN the system SHALL categorize them by severity and component affected
6. WHEN problems are found THEN the system SHALL include screenshots or recordings where applicable
